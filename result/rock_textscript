This week we'll turn our attention to the world of popular music in America before rock and roll really broke in 1955 with that's the date that we're going to give for the beginning of rock and roll though as we continue into the course to see that exactly fixing an exact date is pretty tough to do but let's say it's 1955 we want to know what was the world like before 1955 I'll give a little bit away of what I'm going to say when we get to next week and talk about the birth of rock and roll and say that most scholars will say that rock and roll was the the result of blending together 3 styles that had been a prominent in popular music up too at 1955 in those styles are mainstream pop country western music and rhythm and blues music and those those styles were thought to be very different from each other not only in sound but in terms of the kinds of people who would buy their music so mainstream pop music was mostly purchased and consumed by the the average middle class white consumer rhythm blues was thought of his music for mostly urban African American consumers and country western music was thought of as music for mostly rural white farming community said this kind of thing and so these these these these were really thought of as 3 separate markets even though stylistically there were some real differences the way will proceed is this week what will work and it is in 3 parts will first start talking about mainstream pop out and then we'll move to a discussion of the development of country western in this period before 1955 and then the development of rhythm and blues in this period before 1955 so let's dive right in with mainstream pop here. One of the first things we have to understand about popular music before rock and roll is the song is the primary thing not any particular performance of the basic ID if you were in the music business was to write songs to publish song and try to get as many different people to sing those songs as possible that's very different from the way we think about rock and roll today right or the way we think about it even in the sixties who wants a version of sergeant pepper it isn't done by the Beatles who wants a preconstruction pepper that isn't the one the Beatles released and sanction for unit for release when they did it nobody really you want that particular recording the back in these days it wasn't that way at all the song was the important thing and so in many ways. The the the music business before the mainstream pop business before 1955 was really driven by music publishers music publishers job that we're to get songwriter to write songs and then for them to publish them no yes record them yes get them on the radio yes but the main the way in which they sold the songs was through sheet music now this business of should the business of selling sheet music this is something that has really disappeared in in our current life up almost completely and when was the last time you went to some kind of a music stores are sheet music on the wall even when I was a kid in the seventies you could still buy tons of sheet music but not so much anymore maybe go into guitar center you see all the guitar instruction books on the wall in 1 corner of the store but other than that sheet music is really sort of but way out of our picture it certainly is not the booming business it was put in the first half of the twentieth century the last half of the nineteenth century it was the primary thing that people were were interested in installing if you were a publisher and so the idea was sheet music would be that you would buy the sheet music so you could play their home and back in those days a lot of people had pianos in the living room it was like you know having a stereo or a big screen TV is is today and there were people who in the family who could play the piano often multiple members of the family and so you would go up to the local 5 and dime and you would pick out the song that you wanted to buy that week or maybe a couple of songs they stole so much sheet music that the stores actually had resident a piano and a resident pianist right there in the store to play the music for you so that you can hear IT before you bought this is how the how important the sheet music business wasn't so people would take this music back to the home and they would perform it to themselves now when recording started to become more more prevalent in the first half of the century into the 19 twenties and 19 thirties people had recordings and recordings of course were important coming but you probably didn't have as many recordings in the house and she had sheet music so recording for that special instance where you want to hear something recorded by a party. The person maybe it was Judy Garland or Bing Crosby or something like that but otherwise sheet music was the big thing of course rock and roll didn't rely very much on sheep and 6 this was 1 of the apple carts that rock and roll upset when it became so popular in 1955 the other thing we have to remember when we think about a popular music in this period is that song writers and performers were essentially thought it is entirely different kinds of people are different kinds of jobs a song writer was somebody who wrote a song and that was wrote songs that's what they did they didn't particularly perform them they didn't even have to have great piano skills or great singing voices but they had to be able to write the songs they would turn out song after song after song sometime to formulate kind of way but also sometimes in extremely interesting which if you know the songs of George and ira Gershwin for example Cole Porter a lot of these these these classics on letters from the American songbook will fantastic and and and very very a clever and interesting and sophisticated kinds of songs but that was their job there's no recording I didn't have time where if anyone of Cole Porter sings the music of Cole Porter it was really not expected this song lyrics should be able to do that that took singing the songs that is took a performer to be able to do and what performers did is they made their mark by having their own personal style a performer was a song stylist so the way it would work is that a song would become popular in the in the a culture and people would hear the song for various kinds of ways we'll talk about that in just a minute and then these performers would try to put their own special mark on it she might hear a song let's think from a little bit later period something like my way or New York New York that's a great song I wonder what it sounds like if I heard Frank Sinatra sing that song I would it would sound like if I heard Elvis Presley sang that song I wonder would it sound like a herd Liza Minnelli sing that song so the idea was that. Was a song with 1 entity and the performance of it was another entity and these people specialize this is something that we see change in the history of rock music where the the the model starts to be from about the mid sixties that the people who write the songs are the same people who performed the song so the idea of a cover version say in this pre before 1955 it almost doesn't apply because everybody's doing versions of everybody else's songs so this gives us a little bit of an idea of how the music business was structured as pre before 1955 the most important thing to take away from this is that the songs the thing not particular performances of it so now in the next video we need to move on to the idea once we know these songs are the important sort of basic unit of trade how do these songs reach people who are interested in hearing popping music how do they get to decide how do they get to know about them that's what we'll deal with next.
